Hobo-Balls
The initial aim of this product was to create a balanced game of chance in which the player can not exploit any weakness to cheat. I later also used it to explore CSS animations to make it more visually interesting.

---KNOWN BUGS---

Player can use arrows on bet input to bet above their current remaining cash (Use JS to prevent button from being clicked if bet is above current cash).

When player loses it does not show the animation for final cup reveal but instead jumps straight to lose screen.

---Future Improvements---

Create either pop-up at onload or link to instructions for playing the game. Also add brief story to why character is playing.

Alow player to enter bet by pressing enter.

Create option for Easy, Medium and hard versions of game which change cash needed to win.

Sound effects on reveal??? maybe random and occasional??

Fix General Aesthetic:

Shorten bet input field. Make buttons look better. Make glitch effect on heading interval longer and more random with the duration. Remove side borders on heading. On lose screen the bachground of text is uneven, its full on right side not on left.
